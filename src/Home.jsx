                    <p>The Kardashian family (/kɑːrˈdæʃiən/ kar-DASH-ee-ən), also referred to as the Kardashian–Jenner family,[1] is an American family prominent in the fields of law, entertainment, reality television, fashion design, and business. Through different ventures, several members of the family have assets of over $1 billion.[citation needed] Kim Kardashian became a celebrity in 2007, after selling a pornographic film featuring ex-boyfriend, singer Ray J, which enabled the family to rise to stardom.[2] From October 2007 through June 2021, they appeared together on the highly popular, albeit controversial, reality television show Keeping Up with the Kardashians. The show's 14-year run gave and maintained media exposure to each member of the family, allowing them to start and build their individual careers in multiple businesses under their separate brands. </p>
